## Game Design – Part 1: concept

### Concept
“Sunday Knights” (codename)

### Logline
“Embark on a journey to fight back the forces of evil, one puzzle at a time.”

### Introduction
In a faraway kingdom, an ancient danger threatens the people of those peaceful lands. The enemy, the Dreary Army, wants to bring dullness and boredom upon the realm and reduce every inhabitant to a vapid being. An Unnamed Hero and their loyal bird Zeely were chosen for this perilous journey to save everyone from eternal nothingness. The Hero and Zeely will fight to chase away the baddies once and for all. But the presence of Evil in these lands is just one of the mysteries to be unravelled.

### Description (of the game)
This tile-matching game puts the player in front of a series of Match-3 puzzles while narrating a background story. Every level requires players to accomplish some objectives or satisfy certain conditions. Players can alter the game scheme by directly interacting with its elements, or by using power-ups with given side effects. In solo games, players have to clear every puzzle to progress through the story. Multiplayer games let users play story mode together via a shared scheme or one against each other in objective-based rounds. Unlockable in-game items are available, as well as profile customisation and social tools when playing online.

### Key features
Online games let users play against actual people rather than just for the highest score. Interaction with opponents is crucial to winning: each player's moves can alter the opponent's game grid and outcome, while power-ups shake up gameplay in unpredictable ways. Social actions such as quick replies are available during gameplay. Broad customisation is available for both players' profile and avatar to show off items and collectables. Achievements and profile summaries are used to share game progression with other players.

### Platform(s)
Handheld mobile Android smartphones produced in 2014 and later.

### Notes
Nothing to say yet.

## Game Design – Part 2: formal and dramatic elements
Try to describe the game you are conceiving in terms of:

### Formal elements
1. Players  
This game is mainly intended for Bartle's *Achiever* type players with a casual-gamer mindset. That is, the core target audience consists of people looking for a game to spend some spare time on, though committed to completing objectives and unlocking items in the long run. The game delivers a sense of competition via a single-player story mode (*PvE*) and a multiplayer experience that lets users play one against each other in objective-based time matches (*PvP*).

2. Objectives  
The long term goal is to beat every level of the game and gain as many points as possible to be the top player. To finish a puzzle, the player must get a minimum number of points. Competitive matches require the player to gain more points than their opponent(s).

3. Procedures  
On game start, the game grid shows up on the screen, as well as the player's inventory; in multiplayer games, a preview of the opponent's game grid is also visible. Players gain points by matching three or more grid items horizontally or vertically in the game grid. They can trigger a match by selecting an item and moving it over another nearby, resulting in swapping the two; then matched items disappear while the remaining fall down. Finally, new items populate the remaining empty cells. The more the matching items, the more points players score. Longer matches unlock powerful effects too.

4. Rules  
Combinations involve items of the same type/colour only unless otherwise stated. Players can swap adjacent items only, both horizontally and vertically; however, they must be selectable and in any case not in a blocked status. The number of moves available per level is limited, and when the player runs out of them, the game is over.

5. Resources  
**Moves:** the number of actions players perform to move items in the game grid and trigger matches; their maximum value can increase while playing.  
**Effect items:** they appear in the game grid after a long match occurred; players can interact as usual, but when these items match they trigger a side-effect. Longer combinations generate more powerful effect items.  
**Action cards:** they are the “interactive” resource of the game, which the player can use to hinder their opponent or to help their teammates, depending on the effect. An album of "seen" cards keeps track of each one of them the player has ever found. Players can choose the cards to play with from this collection.  
**Stars:** they measure the player's progress for every level, on a scale out of three stars. The higher the score at the end of a game, the more stars unlock for that level.  
**Coins:** the currency players can spend to purchase packs of random consumable items for in-game use.

6. Conflict  
Two teams (that can be composed of one player/agent each) compete to reach the highest score in the level, doing their best while hampering each other.

7. Boundaries  
Players can't directly interact with other players' game grid, or during other players' turn if there's a shared grid. Leaving while playing a game is the same as losing it, granting victory to the other player regardless of whether they're humans or agents.

8. Outcomes  
The first player (or team) to reach the minimum score wins the game. If nobody does, the side with the highest score is the winner. Victory awards 20 coins, and defeat awards 5. Also, winners unlock stars as performance rating, depending on pre-computed score thresholds.

### Dramatic Elements
1. Challenge  
Story mode - The score threshold and the opponent’s “skill” rise throughout the campaign. Level-based mechanics make solutions harder.
PvP mode - Most of the challenge is defined by the opponent’s skill level and playstyle. The level is randomized, introducing level-based mechanics in the player vs player.

2. Play  
There is no “fixed path” to follow to the solution, each player is free to approach the challenge how they prefer. Consumable “shuffling” items give the player freedom to “reset” the scenario if they do not like their position. The player can play more conservatively, focusing on their own performance, or more aggressively by trying to disturb the opponent more.

3. Premise  
The Dreary Army took over the kingdom of Ludenia and enslaved its people. It is up to the player to fight them for the destiny of the land!

4. Character(s)  
Robin - The protagonist of the game alongside the player. Tis a young lad, dressed in robes and a pair of round glasses, capable of some wee magic. Not being powerful enough to fight alone, he asks the player for help.
Dismalius - The enemy the player gets to always see. He is wearing a big, grim helmet with a very sad face on it, and a thick armor with a : ( emoticon on his chest. His broad, one-handed sword has “misery” written on the blade
Zeely - A small bird friend of Robin, is the shopkeeper, and will seel (and seldom gift) packs of items to the player.

5. Story  
The Realm of Ludenia has always been a happy place, until the day the Dreary Army awakened and put the inhabitants under their own rules. You and a handful of friends are fighting back to defeat this wickedness and free the kingdom from the forces of evil. Travel throughout Ludenia and defeat the enemies you meet in your path. Show your knight bravery in puzzle-based battles and unravel the mystery behind the Dreary Army's origin.
