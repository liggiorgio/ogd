## Game Design – Part 1: concept

### Concept
“Sunday Knights” (codename)

### Logline
“Embark on a journey to fight back the forces of evil, one puzzle at a time.”

### Introduction
In a faraway kingdom, an ancient danger threatens the people of that peaceful land. But you and your friends are there to fight back the evil and free people from slavery. Every battle will be a step forward to chasing away the baddies, but a mystery about their presence in these lands is yet to be discovered...

### Description (of the game)
This puzzle game features a story-driven single-player mode, immersing the player in playful Match-3 sessions to fight the Dreary Army and set Ludenia free. And when the player runs out of enemies, here comes the multiplayer mode: they can team together with a friend to overwhelm the Army once again, or challenge each other in turn-based 1v1 matches. In-game progress unlocks trophies, achievements, avatar titles and collectables.

### Key features
This game takes the social Match-3 experience to a higher new level, allowing gamers to play against actual people rather than a simple leaderboard: competition is funnier when there's someone at the other end of the rope. This applies to cooperative games as well, so that teamwork may triumph where a one-man army can't win.
Interaction with the other player is fundamental to victory: each player's moves can change completely their opponent's outcome.
Platform(s): handheld mobile Android devices (a future iOS release may be considered).

### Notes
Nothing to say yet.

## Game Design – Part 2: formal and dramatic elements
Try to describe the game you are conceiving in terms of:

### Formal elements
1. Players  
This game is mainly designed for Bartle's *Achiever* type players with a casual-gamer mindset. That is, the core target audience mainly consists of people looking for a game to spend some spare time on, though committed to completing objectives and unlocking items in the long run. A sense of competition is delivered via a single-player story mode and a multiplayer experience that lets users either fight a series of *AI*-controlled opponents together (*PvE*) or play one against each other in time matches (*PvP*).

2. Objectives  
The long term goal is to beat every level of the game and gain as many points as possible to be the top player. In order to win a level, the player must get a minimum number of points. Competitive matches require the player to gain more points than their opponent(s).

3. Procedures  
On game start, the player is presented with a square game grid and a preview of the opponent's, as well as their own inventory. They gain points by matching three or more items horizontally or vertically in the game grid. They can trigger a possible match by selecting an item and moving it over another nearby, resulting in swapping the two. After a match occurs, the involved items disappear while the remaining fall down, and new items are pushed to the grid from the top.

4. Rules  
In order to score points, a match can occur among items of the same type/colour only, unless otherwise stated. An item can only be swapped with one of those adjacent to it. There is a variable, limited number of moves per level; if the player runs out of them and doesn't fulfill the winning conditions, the game is lost.

5. Resources  
Moves - They are used to move items in the grid and trigger matches; their maximum values can increase while playing.
Special objects - They can be obtained through special combos or be hidden in the level. They have great destructive power.
Stars - The player gains them by clearing levels with higher scores, and needs to reach specific thresholds in order to advance in the story mode.
Items - The “interactive” resource of the game, which the player can spend to hinder the opponent or to help their teammates, depending on the game mode and the item. An “album” of seen items keeps track of everything the player has ever found.
Coins - Can be spent to purchase packs of random consumables.

6. Conflict  
Two teams (that can be composed of one player/agent each) compete to reach the highest score in the level, doing their best while disturbing each other. Victory awards 20 coins, defeat awards 5.

7. Boundaries  
The player cannot swap objects that are not adjacent, cannot move objects that are hidden, locked, frozen, or under any peculiar condition, cannot swap their opponent’s objects, cannot swap objects if they got no moves left.

8. Outcomes  
No player (or team) reaches the minimum score. They both lose.
At least one player (or team) reaches the minimum score. The side with the highest score wins.
Both reach the threshold and reach the same score. The side that ended first wins.

### Dramatic Elements
1. Challenge  
Story mode - The score threshold and the opponent’s “skill” rise throughout the campaign. Level-based mechanics make solutions harder.
PvP mode - Most of the challenge is defined by the opponent’s skill level and playstyle. The level is randomized, introducing level-based mechanics in the player vs player.

2. Play  
There is no “fixed path” to follow to the solution, each player is free to approach the challenge how they prefer. Consumable “shuffling” items give the player freedom to “reset” the scenario if they do not like their position. The player can play more conservatively, focusing on their own performance, or more aggressively by trying to disturb the opponent more.

3. Premise  
The Dreary Army took over the kingdom of Ludenia and enslaved its people. It is up to the player to fight them for the destiny of the land!

4. Character(s)  
Robin - The protagonist of the game alongside the player. Tis a young lad, dressed in robes and a pair of round glasses, capable of some wee magic. Not being powerful enough to fight alone, he asks the player for help.
Dismalius - The enemy the player gets to always see. He is wearing a big, grim helmet with a very sad face on it, and a thick armor with a : ( emoticon on his chest. His broad, one-handed sword has “misery” written on the blade
Zeely - A small bird friend of Robin, is the shopkeeper, and will seel (and seldom gift) packs of items to the player.

5. Story  
The Realm of Ludenia has always been a happy place, until the day the Dreary Army awakened and put the inhabitants under their own rules. You and a handful of friends are fighting back to defeat this wickedness and free the kingdom from the forces of evil. Travel throughout Ludenia and defeat the enemies you meet in your path. Show your knight bravery in puzzle-based battles and unravel the mystery behind the Dreary Army's origin.
