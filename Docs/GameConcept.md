## Game Design – Part 1: concept

### Concept
“Sunday Knights” (codename)

### Logline
“Embark on a journey to fight back the forces of evil, one puzzle at a time.”

### Introduction
In a faraway kingdom, an ancient danger threatens the people of those peaceful lands. The enemy, the Dreary Army, wants to bring dullness and boredom upon the realm and reduce every inhabitant to a vapid being. An Unnamed Hero and their loyal bird Zeely were chosen for this perilous journey to save everyone from eternal nothingness. The Hero and Zeely will fight to chase away the baddies once and for all. But the presence of Evil in these lands is just one of the mysteries to be unravelled...

### Description (of the game)
This tile-matching game puts the player in front of a series of Match-3 puzzles while narrating the background story. Every puzzle requires players to accomplish objectives or satisfy certain conditions; players can alter the game scheme by directly interacting with its elements, or by using power-ups with given side effects. In solo games, players have to clear every puzzle to progress through the story. Multiplayer games let users play story mode together via a shared scheme or one against each other in objective-based rounds. Unlockable in-game items are available, as well as profile customisation and social tools when playing online.

### Key features
Online games allow players to challenge actual people, rather than just earn points. Interaction with opponents is crucial to winning: each player's moves can alter the opponent's game grid and outcome, while power-ups shake up gameplay in unpredictable ways. Social actions such as quick replies are available during gameplay. Broad customization is available for both players' profile and avatar to show off unlocked items and collectables. Achievements and profile resumes are used to share game progression with other players.

### Platform(s)
Handheld mobile Android devices (a future iOS release may be considered).

### Notes
Nothing to say yet.

## Game Design – Part 2: formal and dramatic elements
Try to describe the game you are conceiving in terms of:

### Formal elements
1. Players  
This game is mainly designed for Bartle's *Achiever* type players with a casual-gamer mindset. That is, the core target audience mainly consists of people looking for a game to spend some spare time on, though committed to completing objectives and unlocking items in the long run. A sense of competition is delivered via a single-player story mode and a multiplayer experience that lets users either fight a series of *AI*-controlled opponents together (*PvE*) or play one against each other in time matches (*PvP*).

2. Objectives  
The long term goal is to beat every level of the game and gain as many points as possible to be the top player. In order to win a level, the player must get a minimum number of points. Competitive matches require the player to gain more points than their opponent(s).

3. Procedures  
On game start, the player is presented with a square game grid and a preview of the opponent's, as well as their own inventory. They gain points by matching three or more items horizontally or vertically in the game grid. They can trigger a possible match by selecting an item and moving it over another nearby, resulting in swapping the two. After a match occurs, the involved items disappear while the remaining fall down, and new items are pushed to the grid from the top.

4. Rules  
In order to score points, a match can occur among items of the same type/colour only, unless otherwise stated. An item can only be swapped with one of those adjacent to it. There is a variable, limited number of moves per level; if the player runs out of them and doesn't fulfill the winning conditions, the game is lost.

5. Resources  
Moves - They are used to move items in the grid and trigger matches; their maximum values can increase while playing.
Special objects - They can be obtained through special combos or be hidden in the level. They have great destructive power.
Stars - The player gains them by clearing levels with higher scores, and needs to reach specific thresholds in order to advance in the story mode.
Items - The “interactive” resource of the game, which the player can spend to hinder the opponent or to help their teammates, depending on the game mode and the item. An “album” of seen items keeps track of everything the player has ever found.
Coins - Can be spent to purchase packs of random consumables.

6. Conflict  
Two teams (that can be composed of one player/agent each) compete to reach the highest score in the level, doing their best while disturbing each other. Victory awards 20 coins, defeat awards 5.

7. Boundaries  
The player cannot swap objects that are not adjacent, cannot move objects that are hidden, locked, frozen, or under any peculiar condition, cannot swap their opponent’s objects, cannot swap objects if they got no moves left.

8. Outcomes  
No player (or team) reaches the minimum score. They both lose.
At least one player (or team) reaches the minimum score. The side with the highest score wins.
Both reach the threshold and reach the same score. The side that ended first wins.

### Dramatic Elements
1. Challenge  
Story mode - The score threshold and the opponent’s “skill” rise throughout the campaign. Level-based mechanics make solutions harder.
PvP mode - Most of the challenge is defined by the opponent’s skill level and playstyle. The level is randomized, introducing level-based mechanics in the player vs player.

2. Play  
There is no “fixed path” to follow to the solution, each player is free to approach the challenge how they prefer. Consumable “shuffling” items give the player freedom to “reset” the scenario if they do not like their position. The player can play more conservatively, focusing on their own performance, or more aggressively by trying to disturb the opponent more.

3. Premise  
The Dreary Army took over the kingdom of Ludenia and enslaved its people. It is up to the player to fight them for the destiny of the land!

4. Character(s)  
Robin - The protagonist of the game alongside the player. Tis a young lad, dressed in robes and a pair of round glasses, capable of some wee magic. Not being powerful enough to fight alone, he asks the player for help.
Dismalius - The enemy the player gets to always see. He is wearing a big, grim helmet with a very sad face on it, and a thick armor with a : ( emoticon on his chest. His broad, one-handed sword has “misery” written on the blade
Zeely - A small bird friend of Robin, is the shopkeeper, and will seel (and seldom gift) packs of items to the player.

5. Story  
The Realm of Ludenia has always been a happy place, until the day the Dreary Army awakened and put the inhabitants under their own rules. You and a handful of friends are fighting back to defeat this wickedness and free the kingdom from the forces of evil. Travel throughout Ludenia and defeat the enemies you meet in your path. Show your knight bravery in puzzle-based battles and unravel the mystery behind the Dreary Army's origin.
